      Debt is a common aspect of many people's financial lives. Whether it's a
      credit card balance, a medical bill, or a loan payment, managing debts can
      sometimes become challenging. When debts go unpaid for an extended period,
      creditors often turn to a specialized group of professionals known as
      "debt collectors." In this blog post, we'll explore the role of debt
      collectors, what they do, and the rights of consumers when dealing with
      them.

    <BlogHeading variant="h4">Who are Debt Collectors?</BlogHeading>
    <Typography>
      Debt collectors are individuals or agencies hired by creditors to recover
      outstanding debts from consumers who have fallen behind on their payments.
      They can work in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and
      telecommunications. Their primary mission is to collect the debt on behalf
      of the original creditor or lender.

      While debt collectors have a job to do, they must adhere to specific rules
      and regulations set forth by laws like the Fair Debt Collection Practices
      Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). As a
      consumer, you have rights when dealing with debt collectors:
